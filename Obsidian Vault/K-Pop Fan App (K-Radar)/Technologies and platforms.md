- Use of a web app preferable. App could be used both on a web browser and on phones.
- NodeJS - for testing.
- Expo - platform to both develop and perhaps later publish an app. Expo uses React like components witch is familiar. It also allows to create phone OS specific native components/extensions for both iOS (Swift) and Android (No clear use for right now since using such modules impedes app's idea to be "accessible from anywhere" - might be useful in troubleshooting etc.).
- No use of backend projected as of right now - if the app will need to use LLM, could a solution be to create a small dataset to run locally on client? There are definitely apps on i.e. iPhones that run whole GPT (albeit downsized because of hardware limitations) datasets.
