Have an app that would get information about selected K-pop idol/group from the web and display it in one place.

Displayed information should be free of "junk" by default - use of LLM or ML?

When parsing information, there is an idea to display it in "calendar mode" - dates regarding an event/show/sponsorship could be displayed in a friendly manner to the end user.

Ideally information scraping and gathering (including parsing) should be done from the client app. The lesser any sort of backend will be used, the better longevity of an app ("Future proofing").

    Backend is now included. Better usability. Client parsing perhaps in later additions of the app.

Primary use should be a native app. Use of web browser acceptable.

    Let's trying to push this product atleast somewhere... Reprioritising to a web app with PWA support. Easier to manage, deploy. No need to have a publisher/developer account.

NO COMMENTS. At least in the beginning. Too much noise, toxicity. GDPR or similar user protections make data collection non desirable (Nor there is a want to do that. Unethical. Have no purpose for that.).
